# Pearl With No Chunk <img src="src/main/resources/icon.png" alt="Four years late and counting for this joke" width=36>

Tiny\* utility mod that disables chunk loading for Ender Pearls in Minecraft 1.21.3 and beyond, should other
conventional modded solutions for chunk-loading be preferred.

*\*Literally only a single Mixin class. 99.9% of the final JAR's file size comes from the (dated and stupid joke) icon
you see above.*
